                <p>
                    I'm an assidious fourth year student studying at the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
                    currently seeking a degree in Computer Science. I found my desire to work in the teck field
                    in high school when I took drafting, and have since made it my goal to further my understanding
                    of how tech and systems blend together to improve our everyday life. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of class, I enjoy playing trombone - i've been playing for roughly 8 years now and have
                    had the oppertunity of playing some really nice pieces composed by world-class musicians, like 
                    <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV6NeTIQUxc" target="_blank">Symhpony No.2</a></i> composed by Frank Ticheli.

                        Thank you for taking the time to read through my portfolio - though barebones, I hope to
                        expand it in the upcoming year.
